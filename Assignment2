2> Deployment
  1)Set the minReadySec say 10 sec,
    #kubectl patch deployment kubia -p '{"spec": {"minReadySeconds": 10}}'
    #kubectl describe pod kubia
  2)set image on the deployment,
    #kubectl set image deployment <deployment_name> <image_name>=<image_to_be_upgraded>
	Ex: #kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v3
  Note: the image we are pulling must be present in docker hub.
    #kubectl get rs
	#kubectl get po -o wide
	#curl <node_ip:port>  -->shows which image is running in that particular node.
